/**
 * @brief The GazeboConfigReader class allows the user to obtain an instance
 * of the ConfigReader class inside a Gazebo plugin.
 *
 * During the refactoring of the Hardware in The Loop (HIL) server plugins, the
 * need to read the ConfigReader object arose.
 *
 * Usually, the plugins are expected to read the path of the file from a ROS
 * parameter and create its own instance of the ConfigReader object with the
 * file path, however, the HIL plugins cannot rely on ROS, because we plan on
 * removing the depency on ROS completely to allow the use of the synchronous
 * HIL mode in low spec hardware.
 *
 * To fullfill this issue, a new plugin, the ConfigReader, was developed.
 * This is a system plugin launched at the start of every simulation that
 * provides a service using the Gazebo tranport layer that can be quired for
 * the content of the ConfigReader file.
 *
 * This class is a helper that allows users to obtain an instance of the
 * ConfigReader object inside Gazebo plugins, without any run time depency
 * on ROS. When a new instance is requested, a message is sent on the ~/request
 * topic and wait for a response message in the ~/response topic.
 *
 * The response message contains the content of the config.xml file encoded
 * as a GzString message, this content will be parsed to a std::string object
 * and fed to the ConfigReader parser. If the process succeeds a pointer to
 * an instance of the ConfigReader class is returned.
 *
 * Note that the user must take ownership and delete this instance after it is
 * no longer used.
 *
 * This class only works if the ConfigReader plugin is loaded successfully, what
 * is expected during normal simulator operation.
