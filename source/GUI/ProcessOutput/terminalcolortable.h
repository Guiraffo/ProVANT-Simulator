/**
 * @brief The TerminalColorTable class provides a standard color table to
 * implement the color output of the processes shown in the ProcessOutputWindow.
 * This table defines all of the options contained in the original 4 bit
 * (16 color) table of terminals such as the classic VT100, or graphical modes
 * such as VGA.
 *
 * The colors are defined as a mix and match of the most visually pleasant
 * colors of common terminal emulators, such as the Ubuntu default terminal,
 * Konsolo, xterm, PuTTY, VSCode, Windows 10 and PowerShell.

   * @brief lookup88ColorCode
   *
   * Implements a color lookup table for compatiblity with the 88 colors mode.
   * The table was created with information from
   * http://urwid.org/manual/displayattributes.html#id7.
   *
   * The 88 color table is composed of
   * * 16 base colors, that are identic to the ones implemented in the 256
   * color table;
   * * A 4 * 4 * 4 (64 colors) cube skewed towards the brighter RGB colors;
   * * A grayscale table with 16 steps from (8, 8, 8) to (238, 238, 238).
   *
   * The base colors are implemented as a lookup table in the form of a
   * switch statement. @see lookup16BaseColors().
   * The color cube is separeted in the 3 base components, and then a lookup
   * table is applied to convert the code to an equivalent RGB value in the
   * following form:
   *
   * Code -> RGB Value
   * 0    -> 0 (0x0)
   * 1    -> 136 (0x88)
   * 2    -> 204 (0xCC)
   * 3    -> 255 (0xFF)
   *
   * This was not implemented in an algebraic form because the components
   * are not linearly distributed and are heavily skewed towards brighter
   * (higher) values, and the table is small enough to provide acceptable
   * performance.
   *
   * The grayscale lookup table is calculted from the following mathematical
   * expression: 6 * code - 429.
   *
   * @param code Lookup table index.
   * @return RGB equivalent to the code in a 88 colors lookup table.

   *
   * The 256 values table is composed of 16 base colors (8 plain and 8 high
   * intensity colors), a color cube of 6 * 6 * 6 (216 colors) and a grayscale
   * pallete with 24 steps from (8, 8, 8) to (238, 238, 238).
   *
   * The 16 base colors are implemented as a lookup table, the color cube
   * is implemented with a combination of a test to ensure that the 0 code
   * returns the correct value and an algebraic equation. Finally the
   * grayscale conversion is calculated from the following mathematical
   * expression: 10 * code - 2312;
