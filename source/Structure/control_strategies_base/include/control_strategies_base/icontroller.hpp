 * @brief The Icontroller is the interface for implementation of every control
 * strategy used in the ProVANT simulator.
 * 
 * This interface defines the methods that are used to initialize and execute
 * the control strategy internal loop, and methods that are used to determine
 * the references, state vector, error vector at every step time. These methods
 * are used to generate the log files that can be latter imported in Matlab to
 * generate graphs, calculate performance indexes or any other desired evalution
