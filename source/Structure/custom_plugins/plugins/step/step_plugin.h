 * @brief The StepPlugin is a class that exposes a topic that allows a ROS node
 * to control the steps of the Gazebo simulation, and thus control the pace of
 * the simulation.
 *
 * This plugin is a fundamental component of the ProVANT Simulator, and it is
 * the piece that allows the controller node to assume control of simulation
 * timing, and thus allowing the control strategies to take as much time as it
 * needs to compute the control inputs to apply in the model, while the
 * simulation time is advanced only the time specified in the physics paramters.
 *
 * If the simulation is in Hardware In the Loop (HIL) mode, as indicated by the
 * "ok" parameter in the plugin SDF options, this plugin loads, but does not
 * do anything.
 *
 * @todo Change the name of the ok parameter to something which has at least
 * a ressemblance of meaning.
