/**
 * @brief The ConfigPlugin is a Gazebo system plugin that receives an option
 * containing the path the config.xml file for the current simulation and
 * provides a service that allows recovery of this content.
 *
 * This plugin is a crucial part of the infrastructure developed to allow other
 * plugins, especially the plugins developed for the synchronous hardware in the
 * loop (HIL) server plugins that cannot rely on ROS for their functionality.
 *
 * This plugin uses the Gazebo response and request mechanism to provide the
 * contents of the config.xml file that contains the settings for the current
 * simulation such as the control strategy name and simulation mode.
 *
 * When a message is received in the Gazebo ~/request topic, the service
 * providers must check the request field of the request protobuf message. This
 * field identifies the service that is being requested. If the service provides
 * the requested service, it must publish a response protobuf message in the
 * ~/response gazebo topic.
 *
 * The reponse message must contain the same ID and request as the received
 * request message. The field response is used to identify if the process
 * succeed or failed and any other status about the service. Optionally a
 * response message can contain a byte encoded protobuf message.
 *
 * To use the optional response fields, the type field must contain the type
 * name of the encoded message, and the data field must contain the serialized
 * message.

   * of the file are read, and fed to the ConfigReader class to ensure that
   * the contents are a valid XML file and can be correctly parsed.
