 * @brief The Auto Stepping GUI Plugin is a Gazebo GUI plugin that shows a
 * GUI overlay widget that allows controlling the simulation mode in the
 * ProVANT Simulator controller.
 *
 * This class contains two buttons, one that allows starting and pausing the
 * simulation, and one that allows the user to advance the simulation by a
 * single step.
 *
 * This plugin was created in order to facilitate the debugging process of
 * control strategies and plugins other plugins for the simulator, and to
 * allow the user greater control of a simulation. For example, with the use
 * of this plugin, the user can finish a simulation without having to kill the
 * Gazebo GUI and Server when an experiment is finished.
