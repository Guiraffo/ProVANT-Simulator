# ProVANT Simulator GUI Plugins

## A Special Note for this package

For some unknown reason, the plugins are only loaded correctly into Gazebo, if
the header and source files are kept in the same folder.
For this reason, this package does not follow the standard in separating headers
into the include/${PROJET_NAME} folder. Please note that this exception should
not be copied into other packages, unless that are some specific reason to do 
so.

If you know how to fix this problem. Please do.
