/**
 * @brief The Sync Camera Manager is a Gazebo World plugin created to manage synchronize the capture of user camera
 * frames according to the simulation steps.
 *
 * Due to the Gazebo architecture which is divided into client and server applications, the plugins running on those
 * components do not have access to all features. Crucially for the case of this plugin, plugins running on the
 * Gazebo server, such as system, world, model, sensor, and visual plugins do not have access to the user camera.
 *
 * The plugins running on the client application, such as system and GUI plugins have access to the user camera, but
 * don't have access to the WorldUpdateBegin and WorldUpdateEnd signals, nor any other way that provides synchronized
 * access to the gazebo step iteration process.
 *
 * Due to the constraints of each of these plugins, the SyncCameraManager was designed to provide a solution. This
 * plugin runs on the Gazebo server, and keeps a list of active camera recorders, on the end of each step update, the
 * plugin will send a request using the Gazebo transport system, and wait for the response from all of the currently
 * active synchronized camera recorders. This ensures that the step is only advanced after each of those recorders
 * captured and saved a new video frame.
 *
 * Note that this action is only possible because the Gazebo request and response cycle is synchronous, providing
 * functionality similar to ROS services. In this case synchronous means that when a request is made, the execution
 * of the program blocks until a response is received or a timeout ocurred.
 *
 * When a synchronized camera recorder is loaded, it must send a request to the Sync Camera Manager plugin informing
 * that a recorder is enabled. The manager plugin will then send a request to the recorder, querying the step number
 * in which the recorder must be enabled.
 *
 * After the initialization, the manager plugin will pause the simulation on each step time, and wait for a response
 * from the recorder, thus allowing correct synchronization between the plugins running on the client and server
 * applications.
