/**
 * @brief The User Camera Follower is a model plugin that manages the pose of a given model so that it tracks the user
 * camera pose.
 *
 * This plugin was designed for use during the creation of presentation videos of the experiments created in Gazebo to
 * give more fine grained control of the video settings. For example, the user camera resolution is defined by the size
 * of the Gazebo client window, and is thus limited by the resolution of the monitor containing the window, by using
 * this plugin, it is possible to record a video in any desired resolution and use the Gazebo client to define the
 * camera pose.
 *
 * However, recording videos with this plugin has some limitations compared to a direct record of the user camera:
 *
 * - Some elements shown in the user camera such as the axis, or rays shown by a few sensors will not be rendered, as
 * this elements only exist for visual guidance of the user and are not represtend in the simulation server.
